# Hello! This is my hand-made trigometry lib.

This is made with the intention of learning, mistakes will happen.
Oh! And this repository is under GNU 2.0.

## TODO:

For this lib, I will create:
- a function to convert degrees to radians *done*
- a function to convert radians to degrees *done*
- a function to calculate the circumference *done*
	- The formula being **2PIr**
- a function to calculate the arc of a radius
	- The formula being **theta = l / r**
- a function to calculate determinants
- And more to come
